# Unofficial DiffInDScene Implementation

This repository contains the basic implementation for the research paper, without including the multi-view scenes reconstruction (MVS).

In our opinion the research paper contains the major limitation in data, since they are being cropped during augmentation, that would result in less accurate of details on reconstruction.
